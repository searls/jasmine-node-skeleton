# jasmine-node-skeleton

This project is a mildly stripped-down starting point derived from the repository [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node). As a result, it currently uses fixed versions of jasmine and jasmine-node, and probably shouldn't be used for any purpose other than getting a simple project started quickly (at or near the date it was uploaded, 1/16/2011).

## Usage

1. [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download)
2. Clone and run:


    git clone git://github.com/searls/jasmine-node-skeleton.git
    cd jasmine-node-skeleton
    ./specs.sh
